    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="speech">Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class="stage direction">[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p>   <p class="speech">And falsehoods the truths
of other people.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="speech">Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
is oneself.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="speech">To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
Phipps.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="stage direction">[_Looking at himself in the glass_.]</p>   <p class="speech">Don’t think I quite
like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="speech">You don’t, Phipps?</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="speech">I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>   <p class="speech">I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
lordship complains of in the buttonhole.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="speech">Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England—they
are always losing their relations.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, my lord!  They are extremely fortunate in that respect.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="stage direction">[_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains
impassive_.]</p>   <p class="speech">Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?</p>
