<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">Three, my lord.</p>   <p class="stage direction">[_Hands letters on a salver_.]</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="stage direction">[_Takes letters_.]</p> <p class="speech">Want my cab round in twenty minutes.</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p>   <p class="stage direction">[_Goes towards door_.]</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>   <p class="stage direction">[_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.]</p>  <p class="speech"></p>Ahem!  Phipps, when
did this letter arrive?

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the
club.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>
<p class="speech">That will do.</p> 
<p class="stage direction">[_Exit_ PHIPPS.]</p>
<p class="speech">Lady Chiltern’s
handwriting on Lady Chiltern’s pink notepaper.  That is rather curious.
I thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say
to me?</p> 
<p class="stage direction">[_Sits at bureau and opens letter_, _and reads it_.]</p> 
<p class="speech">‘I want
you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’</p>
<p class="stage direction">[_Puts down the
letter with a puzzled look_.  _Then takes it up_, _and reads it again
slowly_.]</p>  
<p class="speech">‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.’  So she has
found out everything!  Poor woman!  Poor woman!</p> 
<p class="stage direction">[ _Pulls out watch and
looks at it_.]</p> 
<p class="speech"> But what an hour to call!  Ten o’clock!  I shall have to
give up going to the Berkshires.  However, it is always nice to be
expected, and not to arrive.  I am not expected at the Bachelors’, so I
shall certainly go there.  Well, I will make her stand by her husband.
That is the only thing for her to do.  That is the only thing for any
woman to do.  It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes
marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.  Ten o’clock.  She
should be here soon.  I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else.</p>
<p class="stage direction">[_Goes towards bell_.]</p>

<p class="stage direction">[_Enter_ PHIPPS.]</p>

<h6 class="name">PHIPPS.</h6>  <p class="speech">Lord Caversham.</p>

<h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some
extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.</p>  <p class="stage direction">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
<p class="speech">Delighted to see you, my dear father.</p>  <p class="stage direction">[_Goes to meet him_.]</p>
